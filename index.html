            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>
                I'm passionate about the ever-evolving world of technology. My journey in the field of computer science began at Christ University in India,
                 where I completed my undergraduate studies. During this time, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at Wipro, a prominent IT company. 
                 This experience allowed me to delve into cutting-edge technologies and gain valuable insights into the dynamic tech industry. 
                 It was here that I realized the power of innovation and its potential to transform our world.
    
                Currently, I am furthering my education by pursuing a Master's in Applied Computer Science at Grand Valley State University (GVSU).
                 This program has been instrumental in honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in the field.
                  I'm dedicated to leveraging the education and experiences I've gained to make a meaningful impact in the tech world.
    
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an avid learner who keeps a pulse on emerging technologies and trends. 
                I believe that the key to success in this rapidly evolving field is to stay curious, adapt, and continuously challenge the status quo.

            <h2>Current Project: Art Gallery</h2>
             <p>
            Art Gallery is a significant platform, seamlessly bringing together artists and a large community of art lovers. With the help of this platform, 
            artists can promote their works while giving customers a simple way to find and buy one-of-a-kind items.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The Art Gallery project will employ React.js for frontend development, while the backend will rely on Node.js and Express. 
            MySQL will handle database operations, particularly concerning user profiles and art listings. Security will be bolstered by
             implementing a two-step registration verification process. The project will emphasize responsive design and utilize
              CSS frameworks to ensure smooth user experiences across different devices. Additionally, a RESTful API will 
              streamline communication between frontend and backend components, enhancing overall efficiency.
